# SnakeFX üêç
A game inspired by the classic game Snake, made in JavaFX. Avoid spinning blades and rack up the highest score you can by consuming fruit and power-ups, growing the snake and increasing your score multiplier. Gain bonus points by eating all the colored dots in the arena.

Download the executable here for Windows: https://github.com/supernoob00/SnakeFX/releases/tag/v1.0.0. Also playable on Mac/Linux by running the JAR file included instead (JRE 21 is required).

NOTE: It has come to my attention that the game doesn't work on Linux. Apparently JavaFX runs with a 60 FPS frame rate cap on Windows, but is uncapped on Linux. The lesson here: don't tie your game logic to frame counts like I did. Mac is still untested.
